# How to approch the Interview

- Ask questions untill you fully grasp the problem domain

  - write/draw/diagram your current understanding of the problem on the board
  
- bring up any accomidations(?) at the start 
  - ie: if you have dysgraphia or some other condition that causes consistently bad handwriting 
  - or: you cant talk and write at the same time 
  - BUT: when you do this, always offer a solution - 
    - "Just ask and I can clarify" 
    - Ill stop and explain at the end of each line 

- when doing visuals, or any part of the whiteboard, if you a section that you can reuse youve saved time and space. 
- if you are unsure or still workout sections of your algorithm, sketch out the broad strokes and discuss why they are important while you drill down on the details. 
- Dont be afraid to make changes while writing your algorithm. 

- would you like me to pseudo code? 
- on the job: "Do you have any questions?" 
  - pseudo parts that they had questions on
  - pseudo if I need it 
  - very short on time, Ill pseudo instead of code <--- VERY SHORT ON TIME. 

- any time you can show knowledge about your language and its implimentation, do. 
- if while your coding, and you catch a bug, talk about it and try to fix it. 
- If you are unsure of a detail in how a built in works, mention that. Say that you would catch it when coding, or that you could easily look it up, something along those lines. 
  - MAJOR CAVEAT: If you arent mostly sure of how the built in works, dont use it at all. 
- If you see improve or dry out your code, either take the time to do it, or mention it. 

- be as explicit as you have time/room for

- Big O: 
  - be able to explain the O(n) of your code clearly 
  - know about the big O of any builtins you use and how that will impact your code. If you need to infer based on their function, either ask your interviewer if they want you to use worst case or what you think it might be (if its better) or jsut go with worst case. 

- Talk over your test cases, if you havent already write them down. 
- Step through a few cases (as many as you have time for)
- Ask your interviewer if they have questions early and often (at the end of a "stage" of your whiteboard)
